So, in this project i'm gonna implement TCP completely from scratch.

Note : This project will be partially done by following a tutorial from youtube 

By partially, i mean the videos weren't made to implement all the extensions of TCP. Well, i'm planning to implement all.

TBH.... this project will be "me learning to read RFC's". So that i can read other RFC's and bring it to life through code.
